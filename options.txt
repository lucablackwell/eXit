# plans to make this into a more cohesive experience, will double-check all the things Elliot tries in the show later

You're trapped in a dungeon with your friend.


trapped, both fell down hole, you landed on your friend, they're injured
"The beast chasing you is sure to catch up to you soon, so make haste."


You see a barrel. What do you do?



The barrel rolls aside, and you find a secret tunnel.
What do you do?
You start to escape, but your friend is too weak to go with you. They hand you a note.
What do you do?
It is too dark to read the note.
What do you do?
You crawl through the tunnel. It leads to a beach.
What do you do?
In the water you see a boat.
What do you do?
Congratulations, you're heading to a new world!
