secret room -
    You wake in a cold room. The walls are bare and the carpet is worn.
    The only light is provided by a dim bulb, which hangs loosely from the ceiling.
    Even the air feels unwelcoming and hostile. The bed you lie on is uncomfortable.
    A rickety wooden desk leans against the wall.

    [look at bed]
    The sheets are dusty and coarse. It is obvious that no part of the bed has been cleaned for months.

    [look at desk]
    You approach the desk. The paint is off-white and flaky.
    It seems to be clinging to the wood for dear life.
    A single sheet of paper and a wooden ruler lay on the desk.
    The drawer of the desk is slightly open.
